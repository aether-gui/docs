# `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` lives **inside** the bundle. It's the contract between the builder (which writes it) and the launcher (which reads it at install time).

If `bundle.yaml` is the *input* describing what to build, `manifest.json` is the *output* describing what was actually assembled.

## Where it comes from

Written by build-bundle at the end of a successful build. Packed into the tarball as the top-level entry:

```
bundle.tar.zst
├── manifest.json          ← this file
├── debs/
├── rke2/
├── helm/
├── aether-ops/
└── templates/
```

## Where it goes

Read by the launcher at the start of every `install`, `upgrade`, `repair`, and `check` run. The launcher:

1. Extracts the tarball.
2. Parses `manifest.json`.
3. Compares `schema_version` to the launcher's hardcoded supported version.
4. Uses the manifest to drive the component loop — `DesiredVersion()` on each component returns a value pulled from the manifest.

## Why it exists (and why it's separate from `bundle.yaml`)

`bundle.yaml` contains *intent* ("give me RKE2 v1.33.1"). `manifest.json` contains *reality* ("here are the exact files packed, with hashes"). Two reasons this matters:

1. **The launcher never sees `bundle.yaml`.** The bundle ships without it. The launcher relies on the manifest to know what's inside.
2. **Intent and reality can diverge** — `bundle.yaml` says "ansible"; `manifest.json` says "ansible 2.14.16-1 with these 38 transitive deps." The builder's job is to produce a complete manifest; the launcher's job is to apply it faithfully.

## The shared Go types

`internal/bundle` defines Go types for the manifest schema. **Both the launcher and the builder import those types.** A schema change is a single PR that touches both sides, and the compiler refuses to let them drift.

```go
// internal/bundle (illustrative — see the package for exact types)
type Manifest struct {
    SchemaVersion int                     `json:"schema_version"`
    BundleVersion string                  `json:"bundle_version"`
    BundleSHA256  string                  `json:"bundle_sha256"`
    BuildInfo     BuildInfo               `json:"build_info"`
    Components    ComponentList           `json:"components"`
}

type ComponentList struct {
    Debs       []DebEntry                  `json:"debs,omitempty"`
    RKE2       *RKE2Entry                  `json:"rke2,omitempty"`
    Helm       *HelmEntry                  `json:"helm,omitempty"`
    AetherOps  *AetherOpsEntry             `json:"aether_ops,omitempty"`
    Onramp     *OnrampEntry                `json:"onramp,omitempty"`
    HelmCharts []HelmChartsEntry           `json:"helm_charts,omitempty"`
    Images     *ImagesEntry                `json:"images,omitempty"`
    Templates  *TemplatesEntry             `json:"templates,omitempty"`
}
```

## Schema version handling

The launcher checks `schema_version` before reading anything else. A mismatch aborts preflight with a clear error:

```
reading manifest: unsupported manifest schema version 2 (expected 1)
```

This is the same safety mechanism as `bundle.lock.json` and the state file — refuse ambiguity at load time, not halfway through.

Compatibility rules:

- **Additive changes** (new optional fields) are fine within a major schema version.
- **Breaking changes** (removed fields, renamed fields, changed types) bump the schema version.
- **The launcher can support multiple schema versions** by branching on `schema_version` at parse time — this is how we intend to roll over without forcing lockstep upgrades.

## Bundle checksum

The builder writes `bundle.tar.zst.sha256` next to the archive after the tarball is created. The manifest schema includes `bundle_sha256`, but the current builder leaves it empty in 0.1.x.

## What auditors should look for

The manifest is the primary auditor-facing artifact. A good review process:

1. **Parse `manifest.json`** out of the tarball (`tar -xOf bundle.tar.zst manifest.json`).
2. **Cross-check every `sha256`** against the upstream authoritative source — Ubuntu's Packages index, GitHub release checksums, `get.helm.sh`.
3. **Diff against the previous release's manifest** to see exactly what changed — the same information that appears in the changelog.

For human review, extract the manifest and format it with `jq`.
