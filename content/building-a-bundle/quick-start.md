# Quick start: build your first bundle

How to build the launcher, the bundle builder, and an offline bundle from a checked-out tree of [`aether-gui/aether-ops-bootstrap`](https://github.com/aether-gui/aether-ops-bootstrap).

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22+** — newer versions also work; CI pins 1.22.
- **Node.js 20+ and npm** — only needed if you're building aether-ops from source (i.e. using `ref:` / `repo:` under `aether_ops:` in `bundle.yaml`).
- **`golangci-lint`** — optional, for linting. Install via `make install-lint`.
- **Network access** — the build machine needs to reach Ubuntu mirrors, GitHub, and `get.helm.sh`. The *target* host (where the bundle will be installed) does not need network access; the *builder* does.

## The five Makefile targets you'll use most

```bash
make build              # → dist/aether-ops-bootstrap (launcher)
make build-bundle       # → dist/build-bundle (builder tool)
make bundle             # → dist/bundle.tar.zst + .sha256
make package            # → dist/aether-ops-bootstrap-<version>.tar.gz
make build-all          # both binaries, no bundle
```

## Step-by-step

### 1. Build the launcher

```bash
make build
```

Produces `dist/aether-ops-bootstrap`, a static Linux amd64 binary built with `CGO_ENABLED=0 -trimpath`, with the version injected via `-ldflags`.

The version string comes from:

```
$(shell git describe --tags --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo "dev")
```

So a clean tagged build reads `v0.1.43`; a clean `main` build reads something like `v0.1.43-2-gabc1234`; an uncommitted edit reads `v0.1.43-2-gabc1234-dirty`.

### 2. Build the bundle builder

```bash
make build-bundle
```

Produces `dist/build-bundle`. You usually don't run this directly — `make bundle` depends on it.

### 3. Build a bundle from `bundle.yaml`

```bash
make bundle
```

Internally:

```bash
./dist/build-bundle --spec specs/bundle.yaml --output dist/bundle.tar.zst
```

This reads `bundle.yaml` and:

1. Resolves `.deb` transitive dependencies from Ubuntu Packages indexes.
2. Downloads RKE2 airgap artifacts, verifies SHA256 against the release's checksum file.
3. Downloads Helm from `get.helm.sh`, verifies SHA256.
4. Acquires aether-ops (from the local file, GitHub release, or source build, depending on the spec).
5. Writes or verifies `bundle.lock.json` (see [Lockfile](./lockfile.md)).
6. Stages templates.
7. Generates `manifest.json`.
8. Archives everything into `tar.zst`, writes a `.sha256` sidecar.

First build on a fresh clone takes several minutes (most of that is downloading). Subsequent builds — with the lockfile in place and the content-addressed cache warm — are much faster.

### 4. Package everything

```bash
make package
```

Produces `dist/aether-ops-bootstrap-<version>.tar.gz` containing the launcher, the bundle, and the `.sha256`. This is the single artifact CI attaches to GitHub releases alongside the individual files.

## Multi-bundle mode

The builder also accepts a directory of specs instead of a single file:

```bash
./dist/build-bundle --spec specs/ --output dist/
```

Every `.yaml` file in `specs/` is built into its own bundle named from the spec filename — for example, `specs/core.yaml` becomes `dist/core.tar.zst`. This is the foundation for per-role bundles (see [Multi-node design](../developer/multi-node-design.md)) but is usable today for any case where you want parallel bundle variants.

## Local aether-ops override

When iterating on aether-ops itself, point the spec at a local build:

```yaml
aether_ops:
  version: "v0.1.43-dev"
  source: ./artifacts/aether-ops_0.1.43-dev_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

The CI release workflow strips `source:` lines that reference local paths before running its own build, so this kind of spec is safe to commit for use in development and is automatically neutralized at release time.

## Lint, vet, test

```bash
make vet          # go vet ./...
make lint         # golangci-lint run ./...
make test         # go test -race -cover ./...
```

All three run on every push and PR.

## End-to-end tests

Four DART-driven LXD VM suites exercise the full airgap install flow:

```bash
make test-e2e-bootstrap        # single-node bootstrap (~10-15 min)
make test-e2e-multi-bootstrap  # multi-node bootstrap
make test-e2e-deploy           # single-node full deploy (~30-45 min)
make test-e2e-multi-deploy     # multi-node full deploy
make test-e2e-quick            # both bootstrap suites
make test-e2e                  # all four suites
```

Requires the [DART CLI](https://github.com/bgrewell/dart) and an LXD install with a `default` storage pool. Each suite's `setup/00_build-artifacts.yaml` calls `make build bundle` on the host before pushing artifacts into the VM, so e2e always tests the current tree.

## `dist/` layout after a full build

```
dist/
├── aether-ops-bootstrap                  # the launcher
├── build-bundle                          # the builder tool
├── bundle.tar.zst                        # the offline payload
├── bundle.tar.zst.sha256                 # integrity sidecar
└── aether-ops-bootstrap-<version>.tar.gz # everything packaged
```

`make clean` removes the whole `dist/` tree.
