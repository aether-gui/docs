# aether-ops-bootstrap CLI reference

Every subcommand and flag of the [aether-ops-bootstrap](../../tools/aether-ops-bootstrap) launcher.

## Invocation

```
aether-ops-bootstrap <command> [flags]
```

Bare `aether-ops-bootstrap` (no command) prints usage.

## Commands

### `install`

Full bootstrap from scratch. Refuses to run if a prior successful install exists on this host (see `--force`).

```bash
sudo aether-ops-bootstrap install --bundle bundle.tar.zst
```

Flags:

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--bundle <path>` | yes | Path to the bundle `.tar.zst` file. |
| `--force` | no | Allow re-running on a host with existing state. Existing state is updated in place, not wiped. |
| `--roles <csv>` | no | Comma-separated roles; restricts which components run. Default: all components. See [Roles](#--roles-csv). |
| `--onramp-password <value>` | no | Password for the onramp Ansible user. See [`--onramp-password`](#--onramp-password-value). |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | no | Stream subprocess output (`dpkg`, `useradd`, etc.) live to stderr. |

Exit codes:

- `0` — install succeeded, state file updated.
- non-zero — install failed; a diagnostic tarball was written to `/tmp`.

### `upgrade`

Compare the bundle's manifest to the state file and apply components whose desired version differs from the recorded version. Behaves like `install --force` in that it does not refuse on existing state.

```bash
sudo aether-ops-bootstrap upgrade --bundle bundle-new.tar.zst
```

Flags: same as `install`. `--force` is implied.

### `repair`

Re-run every component's `Apply` regardless of what the state file says. Used to fix drift — a hand-edited config, a removed systemd unit, a file deleted out from under the launcher.

```bash
sudo aether-ops-bootstrap repair --bundle bundle.tar.zst
```

Flags: same as `install`. `--force` is implied.

### `check`

Preflight and plan, then exit without applying component actions. Dry-run.

```bash
sudo aether-ops-bootstrap check --bundle bundle.tar.zst
```

Flags: same as `install`.

Output:

```
running preflight checks...
extracting bundle bundle.tar.zst...
bundle version 2026.04.1 (schema 1)
detected host suite: noble
[debs] would apply ( -> 2026.04.1, 1 actions)
  - install 42 .deb packages
[ssh] would apply ( -> 2026.04.1, 1 actions)
  - drop sshd password auth config
[sudoers] would apply ( -> 2026.04.1, 1 actions)
  - install sudoers drop-in aether.tmpl
...
```

Exit code `0` means the plan succeeded; `check` never reports failure from a component applying because it stops before `Apply`. In 0.1.x, `check` still writes state metadata and a `history` entry for the run.

### `diagnose`

Collect a diagnostic bundle for remote troubleshooting.

```bash
sudo aether-ops-bootstrap diagnose [--output <dir>]
```

Flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--output <dir>` | `/tmp` | Where to write the diagnostic tarball. |

Writes `aether-bootstrap-diag-<timestamp>.tar.gz` containing:

- `/var/lib/aether-ops-bootstrap/state.json`
- `/var/lib/aether-ops-bootstrap/bootstrap.log`
- Recent `rke2-server` and `aether-ops` journal entries
- Relevant config files installed by the launcher

The launcher **also collects diagnostics automatically** on any failed install / upgrade / repair run.

### `state`

Print the current state file as pretty JSON.

```bash
sudo aether-ops-bootstrap state
```

Fails if no state file exists. `jq` works on the output:

```bash
sudo aether-ops-bootstrap state | jq '.components | to_entries[] | .key + " = " + .value.version'
```

### `version`

Print the launcher version (and installed bundle version if state exists).

```bash
aether-ops-bootstrap version
```

Output:

```
aether-ops-bootstrap v0.1.43
installed bundle: 2026.04.1
```

### `help` / `-h` / `--help`

Print usage summary.

## Flags reference

### `--bundle <path>`

Required for `install`, `upgrade`, `repair`, `check`. Path to the bundle tarball. Can be relative or absolute.

### `--force`

Allow `install` to run on a host with existing state. Upgrades and repairs imply `--force`.

What `--force` does **not** do:

- Delete the existing state file.
- Remove installed components (systemd units, users, etc.).
- Reset the history log — it's append-only.

For a true clean install, you must also manually stop / disable services and remove `/var/lib/aether-ops-bootstrap/state.json`. Almost no one needs this.

### `--roles <csv>`

Comma-separated list of roles. Restricts which components run.

Valid roles (case-insensitive, several aliases accepted):

| Canonical | Aliases | Components |
|---|---|---|
| `mgmt` | `management` | `debs`, `ssh`, `sudoers`, `service_account`, `onramp`, `aether_ops` |
| `core` | `sd-core` | `debs`, `ssh`, `sudoers`, `service_account`, `rke2`, `helm` |
| `ran` | `srs-ran`, `ocudu` | `debs`, `ssh`, `sudoers`, `service_account` |

Examples:

```bash
--roles mgmt
--roles management
--roles mgmt,core
--roles SD-Core          # normalized to "core"
```

If `--roles` is **omitted**, every registered component runs (the single-node default). If `--roles` is **present**, the union of requested roles' components runs — anything outside that set is skipped.

Roles are a transitional multi-node mechanism. See [Multi-node design](../../developer/multi-node-design).

### `--output <dir>`

Only for `diagnose`. Defaults to `/tmp`.

### `--onramp-password <value>`

Sets the password for the onramp Ansible user (the account created on the target host that Ansible SSHes into — `aether` by default). Valid on `install`, `upgrade`, `repair`, and `check`.

The password is resolved in this order of precedence:

1. `--onramp-password <value>` — this flag.
2. `AETHER_ONRAMP_PASSWORD` environment variable.
3. `aether_ops.onramp_password` in the bundle spec (strongly discouraged in checked-in specs; useful for gitignored scratch specs).
4. A 24-character random password, generated by the installer and logged to stderr as soon as the launcher resolves it (before component work runs). The launcher prints it under an `IMPORTANT: record this password` header so the value survives a later-stage failure; it is not displayed again.

The password is set on the OS user at first install only. Subsequent `upgrade` / `repair` runs leave an existing password untouched so post-install rotations are not silently reverted. Because of this:

- `install` / `upgrade` / `repair` **require** an explicit source (`--onramp-password`, `AETHER_ONRAMP_PASSWORD`, or `aether_ops.onramp_password` in the spec) whenever the onramp user already exists on the host. Pass the value the user currently authenticates with — the launcher uses it to stamp `hosts.ini` so the daemon's Ansible runs keep working. If you omit it, the launcher refuses rather than silently breaking authentication by writing a mismatched random password.
- `check` (dry-run) never requires a password source and never generates one; it exits with an accurate plan regardless.
- To rotate, change the OS password out-of-band (`sudo passwd aether`) and then re-run `install` / `upgrade` with the new value via `--onramp-password` so `hosts.ini` ends up in sync.

### `--verbose`, `-v`

Stream subprocess output (dpkg, useradd, etc.) live to stderr. Off by default; output is still captured and surfaced on failure.

## Environment variables

- `AETHER_ONRAMP_PASSWORD` — sets the onramp user password. Sits between the `--onramp-password` CLI flag (higher precedence) and the bundle spec's `aether_ops.onramp_password` field (lower precedence). Useful for CI / orchestration contexts where flags are harder to pass cleanly than env vars.

## Exit codes

- `0` — success (or `check` completed with a plan).
- `1` — generic failure. A diagnostic bundle was written.
- Specific non-zero codes are not yet stable; rely on the log output, not the exact exit code.
