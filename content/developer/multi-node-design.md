# Multi-node and multi-role bootstrap — design discussion

:::note Draft / forward-looking
This page describes design direction for **after** the 0.1.x line. The
0.1.x bootstrap is single-node with an optional `--roles` flag. Everything
on this page is "where we want to go", not "what ships today."
:::

## Context

The bootstrap system today handles one role: take a clean Ubuntu server and produce a running management plane (RKE2 + aether-ops). Real deployments need multiple node types with different software stacks.

**Scale target.** Currently small (3-5 nodes), designing for hundreds of gNBs. Bundle size is not a constraint.

## Revised role model

In multi-node deployments, the roles differ from what the current single-node bootstrap assumes:

| Role | What it runs | K8s? | Key components |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Management** | aether-ops only | No | debs, SSH/sudo, service account, aether-ops |
| **SD-Core** | RKE2 server + 4G/5G core NFs | Yes (server) | debs, SSH/sudo, RKE2 server, Helm, SD-Core charts + images |
| **gNB (current)** | Docker + gNB radio software | No | debs, SSH/sudo, Docker, gNB images |
| **gNB (future)** | RKE2 agent + gNB | Yes (agent, joins SD-Core cluster) | debs, SSH/sudo, RKE2 agent, gNB images |

**Important shifts from current design:**

- The management node does NOT need RKE2 or Helm — that moves to SD-Core.
- SD-Core owns the K8s cluster (RKE2 server mode).
- gNBs are currently Docker-only, planned to migrate to K8s agents joining the SD-Core cluster.
- The current bootstrap installs too much on the management node for the multi-node case.

## Core principle

**Bootstrap owns single-node provisioning. aether-ops owns multi-node orchestration.**

The bootstrap's scope is deliberately narrow: take a bare Ubuntu host and make it ready for its role. The bundle defines the role (no `--role` flag needed). Multi-node coordination — pushing bundles, monitoring health, integrating into a fleet — lives in aether-ops, which has a node agent in progress.

## Recommended architecture

### What changes in the bootstrap codebase

**1. Role-specific specs and new components.**

New component types needed:

- `docker` — install Docker/containerd from vendored debs, configure, start.
- `os_tuning` — sysctl, hugepages, CPU isolation for gNB / SD-Core performance.
- `rke2` component gains agent mode (config points at SD-Core server, uses join token).
- `images` component — stage container images into Docker or K8s image store.

The launcher itself needs no `--role` flag because the bundle defines what components to install. The existing component registry + manifest system handles this naturally: if the manifest has no RKE2 entry, the RKE2 component doesn't register.

**2. Depot staging.**

The management bundle's spec gains a `depot` section:

```yaml
depot:
  bundles:
    - specs/sdcore.yaml
    - specs/gnb.yaml
  include_launcher: true
```

A new `depot` component unpacks these to `/var/lib/aether-ops/depot/`. aether-ops reads from there.

**3. Management role slimming.**

For multi-node deployments, the management spec drops RKE2 and Helm. This might mean two management specs (`management-standalone.yaml` for single-node, `management.yaml` for multi-node) or a single spec with optional components.

## Approaches considered

| # | Approach | Summary | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Role-Tagged Composite | One fat bundle, `--role` flag selects components | Simple but wasteful at scale |
| 2 | Multi-Spec Build | One spec per role, right-sized bundles | **Foundation layer — use this** |
| 3 | Bundle Depot | Mgmt carries sub-bundles, aether-ops pushes | **Phase 2 — natural fit with aether-ops agent** |
| 4 | Site Manifest + Orchestrator | New orchestrator drives all nodes from one control point | Duplicates aether-ops' role |
| 5 | Golden Image Factory | Build-time bootstrap inside VMs, deploy by flashing | Future optimization for gNBs at massive scale |
| 6 | Bundle Layers (OCI-style) | Shared base + role deltas, content-addressed dedup | Over-engineered given size isn't a constraint |
| 7 | Pull-Based Agent + Depot | HTTP depot on mgmt, nodes self-bootstrap | Converges with aether-ops node agent |

**1. Role-Tagged Composite Bundle** — One fat bundle contains all roles. Launcher gets `--role <name>` flag, filters which components to apply. Simple but every node carries everyone's artifacts. No automation story. Doesn't scale to hundreds of gNBs.

**2. Multi-Spec Build** — Maintain `specs/management.yaml`, `specs/sdcore.yaml`, `specs/gnb.yaml`. The builder (which already supports `--spec <dir>`) produces right-sized bundles per role. Almost free to implement. Each role gets exactly what it needs.

**3. Bundle Depot** — Bootstrap management node first. Its bundle contains role bundles in a `depot/` directory. aether-ops pushes bundles to other nodes via its Ansible/agent infrastructure. One manual step, then aether-ops automates the rest. Natural fit given the planned node agent.

**4. Site Manifest + Orchestrator** — A `site.yaml` describes every node, role, and IP. A new orchestrator command drives bootstrap across all nodes from one control point. Powerful but duplicates what aether-ops should own. Only makes sense if bootstrap must be fully self-contained.

**5. Golden Image Factory** — Run bootstrap at build time inside VMs to produce pre-baked OS images per role. Deploy by flashing/PXE-booting. Interesting for hundreds of identical gNBs with standardized hardware. Heavy infrastructure requirement, complex upgrade story.

**6. Bundle Layers** — OCI-style layered bundles. Shared base layer + role-specific deltas. Optimal transfer efficiency and natural caching. But significant rework of bundle format, builder, and launcher. Worthwhile only if bundle sizes become a real bottleneck.

**7. Pull-Based Agent + Depot** — Management node runs an HTTP depot server. New nodes run a thin agent that pulls its role bundle and self-bootstraps. Scales naturally, pull-based (no SSH from management to workers). But converges with aether-ops' own planned node agent — should probably BE the aether-ops agent rather than a separate bootstrap agent.

## Phased roadmap

### Phase 1 — Multi-role specs + new components

- Extract today's `specs/bundle.yaml` into `specs/management.yaml` (slim: no RKE2 / Helm).
- Write `specs/sdcore.yaml` (RKE2 server, Helm, SD-Core charts + images).
- Write `specs/gnb.yaml` (Docker, gNB images, OS tuning).
- Add new components: `docker`, `os_tuning`, `images`.
- Add agent mode to the existing `rke2` component (joins an existing cluster using a join token).
- **Already in place:** the builder's `--spec <dir>` multi-spec mode.

**Outcome.** Manual multi-role deployment: operator builds per-role bundles, carries each to the right host, runs `install`.

### Phase 2 — Depot staging

- Management spec gains a `depot:` section declaring role sub-bundles.
- New `depot` component unpacks sub-bundles plus a copy of the launcher to `/var/lib/aether-ops/depot/` on the management node.
- aether-ops gains a "bootstrap node" workflow: push bundle from depot, run launcher remotely, monitor.

**Outcome.** Automated multi-node provisioning from the aether-ops UI. One manual bootstrap of the management node, then everything else is driven from there.

### Phase 3 — Node agent integration (aether-ops work)

- aether-ops' node agent pulls its role bundle from the depot on first contact.
- Agent runs the launcher locally, reports status back.

**Outcome.** Self-service provisioning at hundreds-of-gNBs scale.

### Future — gNB migration to Kubernetes

When gNBs move from Docker to Kubernetes, `specs/gnb.yaml` switches its component set from `docker` to `rke2` (agent mode). The RKE2 agent joins SD-Core's cluster using a join token; token distribution becomes aether-ops' responsibility.

## What the `--roles` flag is (today) and isn't (long-term)

The 0.1.x `--roles` flag (`mgmt`, `core`, `ran`) is a **transitional mechanism** for exercising multi-node shapes before per-role bundles land. It works by filtering which components register on a given run.

In the long run, per-role bundles replace the flag: the bundle *is* the role. If a bundle doesn't include RKE2, the `rke2` component has nothing to do and doesn't run — no flag needed. Today's `--roles` filtering will either disappear or become a no-op once Phase 1 ships.

Existing scripts that pass `--roles` should continue to work until the flag is formally deprecated.

## Open questions

1. **Single-node vs multi-node management spec.** Should there be one `management.yaml` that optionally includes RKE2 (for single-node all-in-one deployments), or two separate specs? The current bootstrap's single-node mode is useful for demos and testing.

2. **Join token flow.** When a gNB (future) or additional SD-Core node needs to join the cluster, where does the join token come from? Options: aether-ops API, depot metadata file, passed as env var to launcher.

3. **SD-Core HA.** Will there be multiple SD-Core nodes forming a K8s HA cluster? If so, the first SD-Core node is RKE2 server init, subsequent ones are RKE2 server join — different configs from the same bundle.

4. **Depot format.** Flat filesystem directory (simple, SCP-friendly) vs HTTP server (enables pull-based agent). Could start as filesystem and add HTTP later.
